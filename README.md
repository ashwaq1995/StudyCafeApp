☕ Study Café App
📋 Project Description

The Study Café App was developed during my Java Bootcamp at Tuwaiq Academy as a full-stack web application that allows students to book study spaces, manage reservations, and collaborate with others in shared environments.
The goal was to combine frontend interactivity with a robust Java backend, demonstrating practical implementation of CRUD operations, API design, and database connectivity.

🧩 Implementation Details

1️⃣ Frontend (React):

Built user interfaces for seat booking, user registration, and schedule management.

Used React hooks for state management and Axios for API calls.

2️⃣ Backend (Java – Spring Boot):

Implemented RESTful APIs for users, bookings, and payment simulation.

Used JPA for database persistence and validation.

Designed layered architecture with Controller → Service → Repository pattern.

3️⃣ Database:

Configured relational database (MySQL) with entities for users, seats, and reservations.
